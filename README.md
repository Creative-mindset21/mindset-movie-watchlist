## Features

- **Search Movies**: Fetch movie data using an API based on user input.
- **View Movie Details**: Display information such as title, release date, rating, and a brief overview.
- **Watchlist Management**: Add movies to your watchlist and remove them as desired.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the web application.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic content and API interactions.
